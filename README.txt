Instructions to run the program:

	--To compile the project:
		$./run.sh

	--To start the shell:
		$bin/exec

Note: Every command is given relative to the project home folder.
	  
Limitations:

1)	Parsing: All sorts of parsing errors are not handled, but all the cases described in the project description is handled except '(' & 	 		')'. The code is supposed to run all sorts of standard commands.

2)	'&', which is used to indicate a background process is assumed to appear at the end of a command, not in the middle.
